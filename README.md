# IOT-controlled-garden
a controlled farm garden for cereal crops using IOT(sensors and actuators) mainly concetrating on harnessing natural elemests like rain, temperature humidity etc for crop growth
So far a code in c language for controlling the green house and the related sensors, you will need a rain sensor, temperature sensor, moisture sensor, water pump and a servo motor. Read the code carefully to get the the pins with respect to the sensors. An arduiono uno board was used. A bluetooth module was attched for the mobile application control.
